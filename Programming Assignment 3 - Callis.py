# ## Directions
# 
# The purpose of this assignment is to give you a chance to get some hands-on experience learning decision
# trees for classification and regression. This time around, we are not going to use anything from the module
# on rule induction; however, you might want to examine the rules learned for your trees to see if they ‚Äúmake
# sense.‚Äù Specifically, you will be implementing a standard univariate (i.e., axis-parallel) decision tree and willcompare the performance of the trees when grown to completion on trees that use either early stopping (for
# regression trees) or reduced error pruning (for classification trees).
# 
# For decision trees, it should not matter whether you have categorical or numeric attributes, but you need
# to remember to keep track of which is which. In addition, you need to implement that gain-ratio criterion
# for splitting in your classification trees. For the regression trees, all of the attributes will be numeric.
# For this assignment, you will use three classification datasets and three regression data sets that you will
# download from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, namely:
# 
# 1. Abalone ‚Äî https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone
# [Classification] Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements.
# 
# 2. Car Evaluation ‚Äî https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation
# [Classification] The data is on evaluations of car acceptability based on price, comfort, and technical
# specifications.
# 
# 3. Image Segmentation ‚Äî https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Image+Segmentation
# [Classification] The instances were drawn randomly from a database of 7 outdoor images. The images
# were hand segmented to create a classification for every pixel.
# 
# 4. Computer Hardware ‚Äî https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Computer+Hardware
# [Regression] The estimated relative performance values were estimated by the authors using a linear
# regression method. The gives you a chance to see how well you can replicate the results with these two
# models.
# 
# 5. Forest Fires ‚Äî https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires
# [Regression] This is a difficult regression task, where the aim is to predict the burned area of forest
# fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data .
# 
# 6. Wine Quality ‚Äî https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
# [Regression] This contains two data sets, one for red wine and one for white. Either combine the data
# sets into a single set for the regression task or build separate regression trees. This is your choice;
# however, we expect

# ### For this project, the following steps are required:
# 
#  Download the six (6) data sets from the UCI Machine Learning repository. You can find this repository
# at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/. All of the specific URLs are also provided above.
# 
#  Implement the ID3 algorithm for classification decision trees using gain-ratio as the splitting criterion.
# 
#  Implement reduced-error pruning to be used as an option with your implementation of ID3.
# 
#  Run your ID3 implementation on each of the three classification data sets, comparing both pruned
# and unpruned versions of the trees. These runs should be done with 5-fold cross-validation so you can
# compare your results statistically. You should pull out 10% of the data to be used as a validation set
# and then use the remaining 90% for cross validation. You should use classification error for your loss
# function.
# 
#  Implement the CART algorithm for regression decision trees using mean squared error as the splitting
# criterion.
# 
#  Incorporate a cut-off threshold for early stopping. If the threshold is set to zero, this should indicate
# no early stopping.
# 
#  Run your CART implementation on each of the three regression data sets, comparing both full and
# stopped versions of the trees. You will need to tune the stopping threshold and should use the same
# procedure for extracting a validation set to serve as your tuning set. The runs should be done with
# 5-fold cross-validation so you can compare your results statistically. You should use mean squared
# error for your loss function.
# 
#  Write a very brief paper that incorporates the following elements, summarizing the results of your
# experiments.
# 
# 1. Title and author name
# 2. A brief, one paragraph abstract summarizing the results of the experiments
# 3. Problem statement, including hypothesis, projecting how you expect each algorithm to perform
# 4. Brief description of algorithms implemented
# 5. Brief description of your experimental approach
# 6. Presentation of the results of your experiments
# 7. A discussion of the behavior of your algorithms, combined with any conclusions you can draw
# 8. Summary
# 9. References (you should have at least one reference related to each of the algorithms implemented, a reference to the data sources, and any other references you consider to be relevant)
# 
#  Submit your fully documented code, the outputs from running your programs, and your paper. Your
# grade will be broken down as follows:
# 
# ‚Äì Code structure ‚Äì 10%
# ‚Äì Code documentation/commenting ‚Äì 10%
# ‚Äì Proper functioning of your code, as illustrated by a 5 minute video ‚Äì 30%
# ‚Äì Summary paper ‚Äì 50%

# # Decision Trees
# 
# 
# **Overview:**
# 
# A Decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning technique. Generally, decision trees employ greedy searches to best partition the feature space so as to explain the target variable.
# 
# The goal of using a Decision Tree is to create a training model that can use to predict the class or value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from prior data(training data).
# 
# In Decision Trees, for predicting a class label for a record we start from the root of the tree. We compare the values of the root attribute with the record‚Äôs attribute. On the basis of comparison, we follow the branch corresponding to that value and jump to the next node.
# 
# 
# ## Types of Decision Trees
# 
# Types of decision trees are based on the type of target variable we have. It can be of two types:
# 
#     1. Categorical Variable Decision Tree: Decision Tree which has a categorical target variable then it called a Categorical variable decision tree.
#     
#     2. Continuous Variable Decision Tree: Decision Tree has a continuous target variable then it is called Continuous Variable Decision Tree.
# 
# ## Terminology
# 
# Root Node: It represents the entire population or sample and this further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets.
# 
# Splitting: It is a process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes.
# 
# Decision Node: When a sub-node splits into further sub-nodes, then it is called the decision node.
# 
# Leaf / Terminal Node: Nodes do not split is called Leaf or Terminal node.
# 
# Pruning: When we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning. You can say the opposite process of splitting.
# 
# Branch / Sub-Tree: A subsection of the entire tree is called branch or sub-tree.
# 
# Parent and Child Node: A node, which is divided into sub-nodes is called a parent node of sub-nodes whereas sub-nodes are the child of a parent node.
# 
# Decision trees classify the examples by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf/terminal node, with the leaf/terminal node providing the classification of the example. Each node in the tree acts as a test case for some attribute, and each edge descending from the node corresponds to the possible answers to the test case. This process is recursive in nature and is repeated for every subtree rooted at the new node.
# 
# 
# ### ID3
# 
# The Iterative Dichotomizer 3 (ID3) algorithm is a non-parametric decision supervised learning algorithm, originally proposed for classification problems. ID3 builds decision trees using a top-down greedy search approach through the space of possible branches with no backtracking. A greedy algorithm, as the name suggests, always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment.
# 
# **Steps in ID3 algorithm:**
# 1. It begins with the original set S as the root node.
# 
# 2. On each iteration of the algorithm, it iterates through the very unused attribute of the set S and calculates Entropy(H) and Information gain(IG) of this attribute.
# 
# 3. It then selects the attribute which has the smallest Entropy or Largest Information gain.
# 
# 4. The set S is then split by the selected attribute to produce a subset of the data.
# 
# 5. The algorithm continues to recur on each subset, considering only attributes never selected before.
# 
# ### CART
# 
# Similar to ID3 but is adapted to regression problems by replacing the entropy expression with MSE.
# 
# ### Attribute Selection Measures
# 
# **Entropy** 
# 
# Entropy is a measure of the randomness in the information being processed. The higher the entropy, the harder it is to draw any conclusions from that information.
# 
# ID3 follows the rule ‚Äî A branch with an entropy of zero is a leaf node and A brach with entropy more than zero needs further splitting.
# 
# **Gini Index**
# The Gini index is a cost function used to evaluate splits in the dataset. It is calculated by subtracting the sum of the squared probabilities of each class from one. It favors larger partitions and easy to implement whereas information gain favors smaller partitions with distinct values. Gini Index works with the categorical target variable ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù or ‚ÄúFailure‚Äù. It performs only Binary splits.The higher the value of Gini index, the higher the homogeneity.
# 
# Steps to Calculate Gini index for a split:
# 
# 1. Calculate Gini for sub-nodes, using the above formula for success(p) and failure(q) (p¬≤+q¬≤).
# 
# 2. Calculate the Gini index for split using the weighted Gini score of each node of that split.
# 
# CART (Classification and Regression Tree) uses the Gini index method to create split points.
# 
# **Information Gain**
# Information gain or IG is a statistical property that measures how well a given attribute separates the training examples according to their target classification. Constructing a decision tree is all about finding an attribute that returns the highest information gain and the smallest entropy.
# 
# Information gain is a decrease in entropy. It computes the difference between entropy before split and average entropy after split of the dataset based on given attribute values. 
# 
# ID3 decision tree algorithm uses information gain.
# 
# **Gain Ratio**
# Gain ratio overcomes the problem with information gain by taking into account the number of branches that would result before making the split. It corrects information gain by taking the intrinsic information of a split into account.
# 
# ### Avoiding Overfitting: Pruning
# 
# The splitting process results in fully grown trees until the stopping criteria are reached. But, the fully grown tree is likely to overfit the data, leading to poor accuracy on unseen data.
# 
# In pruning, you trim off the branches of the tree, i.e., remove the decision nodes starting from the leaf node such that the overall accuracy is not disturbed. This is done by segregating the actual training set into two sets: training data set, D and validation data set, V. Prepare the decision tree using the segregated training data set, D. Then continue trimming the tree accordingly to optimize the accuracy of the validation data set, V.

# # Model Evaluation
# 
# Loss functions are used by algorithms to learn the classification models from the data.
# 
# Classification metrics, however, evaluate the classification models themselves. 
# 
# For a binary classification task, where "1" is taken to mean "positive" or "in the class" and "0" is taken to be "negative" or "not in the class", the cases are:
# 
# 1. The true class can be "1" and the model can predict "1". This is a *true positive* or TP.
# 2. The true class can be "1" and the model can predict "0". This is a *false negative* or FN.
# 3. The true class can be "0" and the model can predict "1". This is a *false positive* or FP.
# 4. The true class can be "0" and the model can predict "0". This is a *true negative* or TN.
# 

# ## Training Learners with Cross-Validation
# 
# Fundamental assumption of machine learning:The data that you train your model on must come from the same distribution as the data you hope to apply the model to.
# 
# Cross validation is the process of training learners using one set of data and testing it using a different set.
# 
# Options:
#     - Divide your data into two sets:
#         1. The training set which you use to build the model
#         2. The test(ing) set which you use to evaluate the model. 
#     - kfolds: Yields multiple estimates of evaluation metric
# 
#     
# ### k-fold Cross-Validation
# 
# Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample.
# 
# The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups (or folds) that a given data sample is to be split into. As such, the procedure is often called k-fold cross-validation. When a specific value for k is chosen, it may be used in place of k in the reference to the model, such as k=5 becoming 5-fold cross-validation.
# 
# 
# The general procedure is as follows:
# - Shuffle the dataset randomly.
# - Split the dataset into k groups (or folds)
# - Save first fold as the validation set & fit the method on the remaining k-1 folds
# - For each unique group:
#     - Take the group as a hold out or test data set
#     - Take the remaining groups as a training data set
# - Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set
# - Retain the evaluation score and discard the model
# - Summarize the skill of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores
#     - The average of your k recorded errors is called the cross-validation error and will serve as your performance metric for the model
# 
# Importantly, each observation in the data sample is assigned to an individual group and stays in that group for the duration of the procedure. This means that each sample is given the opportunity to be used in the hold out set 1 time and used to train the model k-1 times.
# 
# Below is the visualization of a k-fold validation when k=10.
# 
# Looks like:
# 
# |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10 |
# |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
# | **Test** | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train |
# 
# |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10 |
# |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
# | Train| **Test** | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train |
# 
# |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10 |
# |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
# | Train| Train | **Test** | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train |
# 
# And finally:
# 
# |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10 |
# |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
# | Train| Train | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train | Train | **Test** |
# 
# ### Stratified k-fold Cross-Validation
# Stratification is the process of rearranging the data so as to ensure that each fold is a good representative of the whole. For example, in a binary classification problem where each class comprises of 50% of the data, it is best to arrange the data such that in every fold, each class comprises of about half the instances.
# 
# For classification problems, one typically uses stratified k-fold cross-validation, in which the folds are selected so that each fold contains roughly the same proportions of class labels.

# ## Parameter Tuning
# 
# Parameter tuning is the process to selecting the values for a model‚Äôs parameters that maximize the accuracy of the model.
# 
# 
# A machine learning model has two types of parameters:
# 
#     1. Parameters learned through a machine learning model
#     
#     2. Hyper-parameters passed to the machine learning model
# 
# 
# In KNN algorithm, the hyper-parameter is the specified value of k. 
# 
# Normally we randomly set the value for these hyper parameters and see what parameters result in best performance. However randomly selecting the parameters for the algorithm can be exhaustive.
# 
# 
# ## Grid Search
# 
# Instead of randomly selecting the values of the parameters, GridSearch automatically finds the best parameters for a particular model. Grid Search is one such algorithm.
# 
# Grid Search evaluates all the combinations from a list of desired hyper-parameters and reports which combination has the best accuracy.
# 
# ### Process
# 
# Step 1: Set your hyper-parameters ("param_grid" here).
# 
# Step 2: Fit the model. Use k-fold cross-validation internally on selected hyper-parameters. Store model average & accuracy.
# 
# Step 3: Go back to step 1 changing at least 1 hyper-parameter
# 
# Step 4: Select hyperparameter which gives best performance (highest accuracy)
# 
# Note that the search is not done within each fold. Instead, cross-validation is used to evaluate the performance of the model with the current combination of hyperparameters.

# ## Extract, Transform, Load: Forest Fires Data
# 
# ### Description
# 
# [Regression] This is a difficult regression task, where the aim is to predict the burned area of forest
# fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data .
# 
# Data obtained from:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires
# 
# ### Attribute Information: 13 Attributes (d)
# 
# 1. X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9 
# 2. Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9 
# 3. month - month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec' 
# 4. day - day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun' 
# 5. FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20 
# 6. DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3 
# 7. DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6 
# 8. ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10 
# 9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30 
# 10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100 
# 11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40 
# 12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4 
# 13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84 
# (this output variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make 
# sense to model with the logarithm transform).
